# recursion

## Description

This is my eighth project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. This project contains two prompt responses (see prompts [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion#assignment)). The first takes a given number (stored in the variable num) and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. The second takes in an array and returns a sorted array. For both prompts, I have included in my script both a loop variant and a recursive variant, with examples testing each function in the console. Each solution script is linked to an HTML file so that you may view these log statements in the browser console as you wish.
